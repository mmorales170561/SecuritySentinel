# Security Scanner Dashboard

A comprehensive security scanning tool for web vulnerability assessment and code analysis that runs entirely in the browser. This application can identify security issues in websites and code without requiring any server-side processing.

## Features

- **Web Security Scanning**: Analyze websites for common security vulnerabilities
- **Code Analysis**: Examine code for security issues and best practices
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Detailed findings with severity ratings and remediation suggestions
- **Export Functionality**: Download reports for offline reference or sharing
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **No Server Required**: Runs entirely in your browser

## Getting Started

1. Visit the [Security Scanner Dashboard](https://yourusername.github.io/security-scanner/) (replace with your actual GitHub Pages URL)
2. Select the type of security scan you want to perform
3. Enter your target (URL or code sample)
4. Start the scan
5. Review the detailed findings

## How It Works

This application uses client-side JavaScript to simulate security scanning capabilities. While it doesn't perform actual penetration testing or deep code analysis (which would require server-side processing), it demonstrates the types of vulnerabilities these tools would find and provides educational information about security issues.

## Deployment

To host this application on your own GitHub Pages:

1. Fork this repository
2. Go to repository Settings > Pages
3. Set the Source to "main" branch and Save
4. Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/security-scanner/`

## Customization

You can customize this application by:

- Editing the CSS variables in the HTML file to change the color scheme
- Modifying the vulnerability findings in the JavaScript code
- Adding or removing scan types
